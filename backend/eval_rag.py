"""RAG evaluation harness — measure retrieval + answer accuracy.

Runs a set of question/expected-answer pairs through the chatbot and reports:
  * Retrieval hit-rate — did the expected source circular appear in the citations?
  * Answer accuracy    — did the answer contain the expected keyword(s)?

Use it to compare the chatbot before/after changes (e.g. hybrid retrieval, QA
reader) with an objective number for the thesis evaluation chapter.

Setup:
  1. Ensure MySQL is running and circulars are published.
  2. Edit eval_questions.json (see the template created on first run).
  3. Run:  python eval_rag.py

Each eval item: {"question": ..., "expected_circular": "02/2024",
                 "expected_keywords": ["14 days", "enhanced due diligence"]}
`expected_circular` and `expected_keywords` are both optional.
